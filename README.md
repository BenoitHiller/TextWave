# TextWave

TextWave is an android app that lets you use your phone to display large text by scrolling a message as you wave it back and forth. Like a persistence of vision display but with the full resolution of your phone.

## Installation

Go download it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benoithiller.textwave).

You can also just clone this project and import it right into android studio. It should be set up to just build at the push of a button. Warning it won't really do much in the emulator because you can't really wave it around.
